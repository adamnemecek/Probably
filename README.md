Probably is a set of Swift structures for computing the probability and
cumulative distributions of different probablistic functions.

Right now, it supports:

  - Standard distributions with explicit event probabilities
  - Continuous distributions
  - Binomial distributions
  - Hypergeometric distributions
  - Poisson distributions
  - Gaussian distributions
  - Negative Binomial distributions
